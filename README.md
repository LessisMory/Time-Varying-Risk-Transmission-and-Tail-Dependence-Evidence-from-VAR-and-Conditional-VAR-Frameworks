# Time-Varying-Risk-Transmission-and-Tail-Dependence-Evidence-from-VAR-and-Conditional-VAR-Frameworks
This project studies time-varying risk transmission and tail dependence
in financial time series using VAR-based frameworks.

By combining standard VAR, time-varying parameter VAR (TVP-VAR),
and conditional VAR approaches, the analysis examines how shock
propagation mechanisms evolve over time and intensify under extreme
market conditions.

The project is designed to bridge rigorous time-series econometrics
with practical risk modeling, providing insights relevant for
quantitative risk management, systemic risk analysis, and
forecast-driven decision making.
